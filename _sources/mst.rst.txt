Minimum spanning trees
=======================

Using the distances and a network, you can generate a minimum spanning tree. This
can be useful when a neigbour joining tree is difficult to produce, for example
if the dataset is very large, and in some cases has uses in tracing spread
(take care with this interpretation, direction is not usually obvious).

There are three different ways to make MSTs, depending on how much data you have.
Roughly:

- 'Small': Up to :math:`\sim 10^3` samples.
- 'Medium': Up to :math:`\sim 10^5` samples.
- 'Large': Over :math:`10^5` samples.

In each mode, you can get as output:

- A plot of the MST as a graph layout, optionally coloured by strain.
- A plot of the MST as a graph layout, highlighting edge betweenness and node degree.
- The graph as a graphml file, to view in :ref:`cytoscape-view`.
- The MST formatted as a newick file, to view in a tree viewer of your choice.

With small data
---------------
For a small dataset it's feasible to find the MST from your (dense) distance matrix.
In this case you can use :doc:`visualisation` with the ``--tree`` option:
use ``--tree both`` to make both a MST and NJ tree, or ``--tree mst`` to just make
the MST::

    poppunk_visualise --ref-db listeria --tree both --microreact --output dense_mst_viz

    Graph-tools OpenMP parallelisation enabled: with 1 threads
    PopPUNK: visualise
    Loading BGMM 2D Gaussian model
    Completed model loading
    Generating MST from dense distances (may be slow)
    Starting calculation of minimum-spanning tree
    Completed calculation of minimum-spanning tree
    Drawing MST
    Building phylogeny
    Writing microreact output
    Parsed data, now writing to CSV
    Running t-SNE

    Done

Note the warning about using dense distances. If you are waiting a long time at this
point, or running into memory issues, considering using one of the approaches below.

.. note::

    The default in this modeis to use core distances, but you can use accessory or Euclidean
    core-accessory distances by modifying ``--mst-distances``.

This will produce a file ``listeria_MST.nwk`` which can be loaded into Microreact,
Grapetree or Phandango (or other tree viewing programs). If you run with ``--cytoscape``,
the .graphml file of the MST will be saved instead.

You will also get two visualisations of a force-directed graph layout:

.. list-table::

    * - .. figure:: images/mst_small_clusters.png

           MST coloured by strain

      - .. figure:: images/mst_small_stress.png

           MST coloured by betweenness

The left plot colours nodes (samples) by their strain, with the colour selected
at random. The right plot colours and sizes nodes by degree, and edges colour and
width is set by their betweenness.

With medium data
----------------
As the number of edges in a dense network will grow as :math:`O(N^2)`, you will likely
find that as sample numbers grow creating these visualisations becomes prohibitive in
terms of both memory and CPU time required. To get around this, you can first sparisfy your
distance matrix before computing the MST. The :ref:`lineage-fit` mode does exactly this: keeping
only a specified number of nearest neighbours for each sample.

Therefore, there are two steps to this process:

- Fit a lineage model to your data, using a high rank.
- Use ``poppunk_mst`` to make the MST from the sparse matrix saved by this mode.

As an example, two commands might be::

    poppunk --fit-model lineage --ref-db listeria_all --ranks 50 --threads 4 --output sparse_mst

    poppunk_visualise --ref-db listeria --tree both --microreact  \
    --rank-fit sparse_mst/sparse_mst_rank50_fit.npz --output sparse_mst_viz --threads 4

Ideally you should pick a rank which is large enough to join all of the components together.
If you don't, components will be artificially connected by nodes with the largest degree, at the
largest included distance. Look for components to be one::

    Network for rank 100
    Network summary:
            Components      1
            Density 0.3252
            Transitivity    0.5740
            Score   0.3873

This will produce a ``<name>_rank100_fit.npz`` file, which is the sparse matrix to load. You will
also need your dense distances, but only the ``.pkl`` file is loaded to label the samples.
``--previous-clustering`` is optional, and points to any .csv output from PopPUNK.
Note that the clusters produced from your high rank fit are likely to be meaningless, so use clusters
from a fit you are happy with. These are combined to give samples coloured by strain in the first plot:

.. list-table::

    * - .. figure:: images/mst_medium_clusters.png

           MST from a sparse matrix, coloured by strain

      - .. figure:: images/mst_medium_stress.png

           MST from a sparse matrix, coloured by betweenness

With big data
-------------
For very large datasets, producing a dense distance matrix at all may become totally
infeasible. Fortunately, it is possible to add to the sparse matrix iteratively by making
a lineage fit to a subset of your data, and then repeatedly adding in blocks with ``poppunk_assign``
and ``--update-db``::

    poppunk --create-db --r-files qfile1.txt --output listeria_1
    poppunk --fit-model lineage --ref-db listeria_1 --ranks 500 --threads 16
    poppunk_assign --ref-db listeria_1 --q-files qfile2.txt --output listeria_1 --threads 16 --update-db
    poppunk_assign --ref-db listeria_1 --q-files qfile3.txt --output listeria_1 --threads 16 --update-db

This will calculate all vs. all distances, but many of them will be discarded at each stage,
controlling the total memory required. The manner in which the sparse matrix grows is predictable:
:math:`Nk + 2NQ + Q^2 - Q` distances are saved at each step, where :math:`N`
is the number of references, :math:`Q` is the number of requires queries and :math:`k` is the rank.


If you split the samples into roughly equally sized blocks of :math:`Q` samples,
the :math:`Q^2` terms dominate. So you can pick :math:`Q` such that :math:`\sim3Q^2`
distances can be stored (each distance uses four bytes). The final distance matrix
will contain :math:`Nk` distances, so you can choose a rank such that this will fit in
memory.

You may then follow the process described above to use ``poppunk_visualise`` to generate an MST
from your ``.npz`` file after updating the database multiple times.

Using GPU acceleration for the graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As an extra optimisation, you may add ``--gpu-graph`` to use `cuGraph <https://docs.rapids.ai/api>`__
from the RAPIDS library to calculate the MST on a GPU::

    poppunk_visualise --ref-db listeria --tree both --rank-fit sparse_mst/sparse_mst_rank50_fit.npz\
    --microreact --output sparse_mst_viz --threads 4 --gpu-graph

    Graph-tools OpenMP parallelisation enabled: with 1 threads
    Loading distances into graph
    Calculating MST (GPU part)
    Label prop iterations: 6
    Label prop iterations: 5
    Label prop iterations: 5
    Label prop iterations: 4
    Label prop iterations: 2
    Iterations: 5
    12453,65,126,13,283,660
    Calculating MST (CPU part)
    Completed calculation of minimum-spanning tree
    Generating output
    Drawing MST

This uses `cuDF <https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/>`__ to load the sparse matrix
(network edges) into the device, and cuGraph to do the MST calculation. At the end, this
is converted back into graph-tool format for drawing and output. Note that this process
incurs some overhead, so will likely only be faster for very large graphs where calculating
the MST on a CPU is slow.

To turn off the graph layout and drawing for massive networks, you can use ``--no-plot``.

.. important::

    The RAPIDS packages are not included in the default PopPUNK installation, as they
    are in non-standard conda channels. To install these packages, see the `guide <https://rapids.ai/start.html#get-rapids>`__.
